A rudimentary Go filetype plugin. Provides syntax files and basic settings for
go files.

This is a fork of some of the vim files originally stored in the main go
repository under misc/vim/.

If you're doing serious go development, you probably want to install a more
full-featured plugin like https://github.com/fatih/vim-go, which includes lots
of useful commands and utilities.
